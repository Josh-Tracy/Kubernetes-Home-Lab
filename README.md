# Kubernetes-Home-Lab

A repository for the Ansible playbooks used in my Youtube video series. In this series I go over configuring my Raspberry Pi 4 cluster as a Kubernetes cluster using Kubeadm. I also automate the process as much as I can using these Ansible playbooks.

Each playbook role comes with a README file outling the manual commands as well if Ansible is not somethign the user wishes to use for this proces .
