# Tasks for bootstrapping the cluster

#Objectives
#Install a single control-plane Kubernetes cluster
#Install a Pod network on the cluster so that your Pods can talk to each other

# Initializing your control-plane node ( MASTER )
# (Recommended) If you have plans to upgrade this single control-plane kubeadm cluster to high 
# availability you should specify the --control-plane-endpoint to set 
# the shared endpoint for all control-plane nodes.
# Such an endpoint can be either a DNS name or an IP address of a load-balancer

# nginx LB IP = 192.168.50.117
